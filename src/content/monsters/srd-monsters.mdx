          While underwater, the aboleth is surrounded by transformative mucus. A
          creature that touches the aboleth or that hits it with a melee attack
          while within 5 ft. of it must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On
          a failure, the creature is diseased for 1d4 hours. The diseased creature
          can breathe only underwater.

        content: >-
          If a creature communicates telepathically with the aboleth, the aboleth
          learns the creature's greatest desires if the aboleth can see the
          creature.

          Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 +
          5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a
          DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become diseased. The disease has no
          effect for 1 minute and can be removed by any magic that cures disease.
          After 1 minute, the diseased creature's skin becomes translucent and
          slimy, the creature can't regain hit points unless it is underwater, and
          the disease can be removed only by heal or another disease-curing spell
          of 6th level or higher. When the creature is outside a body of water, it
          takes 6 (1d12) acid damage every 10 minutes unless moisture is applied
          to the skin before 10 minutes have passed.

      - name: Enslave (3/day)
        content: >-
          The aboleth targets one creature it can see within 30 ft. of it. The
          target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically
          charmed by the aboleth until the aboleth dies or until it is on a
          different plane of existence from the target. The charmed target is
          under the aboleth's control and can't take reactions, and the aboleth
          and the target can communicate telepathically with each other over any
          distance.\nWhenever the charmed target takes damage, the target can
          repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. No more than
          once every 24 hours, the target can also repeat the saving throw when it
          is at least 1 mile away from the aboleth.

      - name: Change Shape

          The deva magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a
          challenge rating equal to or less than its own, or back into its true
          form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is
          wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the deva's
          choice).\nIn a new form, the deva retains its game statistics and
          ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and
          special senses are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any
          statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary actions,
          and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks.

          Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or smaller
          creature. Hit: The creature is grappled (escape DC 13). Until this
          grapple ends, the target is restrained, blinded, and at risk of
          suffocating, and the rug can't smother another target. In addition, at
          the start of each of the target's turns, the target takes 10 (2d6 + 3)
          bludgeoning damage.

          The ankheg spits acid in a line that is 30 ft. long and 5 ft. wide,
          provided that it has no creature grappled. Each creature in that line
          must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) acid damage on
          a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

        content: >-
          If a creature starts its turn within 30 ft. of the basilisk and the two
          of them can see each other, the basilisk can force the creature to make
          a DC 12 Constitution saving throw if the basilisk isn't incapacitated.
          On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is
          restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn.
          On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified
          until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.\nA creature
          that isn't surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the
          start of its turn. If it does so, it can't see the basilisk until the
          start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If it looks at
          the basilisk in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.\nIf the
          basilisk sees its reflection within 30 ft. of it in bright light, it
          mistakes itself for a rival and targets itself with its gaze.
