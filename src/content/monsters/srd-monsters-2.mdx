      - name: Freedom of Movement
        content: |
          The kraken ignores difficult terrain, and magical effects can't reduce its speed or cause it to be restrained. It can spend 5 feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or being grappled.
      - name: Siege Monster
        content: The kraken deals double damage to objects and structures.
    actions:
      - name: Multiattack

        content: |
          _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 23 (3d8 + 10) piercing damage.

          If the target is a Large or smaller creature grappled by the kraken, that creature is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the kraken, and it takes 42 (<Dice r="12d6" />) acid damage at the start of each of the kraken's turns. If the kraken takes 50 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the kraken must succeed on a **DC 25 Constitution saving throw** at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the kraken. If the kraken dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.

          <Attack n="Bite" h="+7" d="3d8+10" />

          <Attack n="Tentacle" h="+7" d="2d6+10" />
      - name: Fling
        content: |
          One Large or smaller object held or creature grappled by the kraken is thrown up to 60 feet in a random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (<Dice r="1d6" />) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a **DC 18 Dexterity saving throw** or take the same damage and be knocked prone.
      - name: Lightning Storm
        content: |
          The kraken magically creates three bolts of lightning, each of which can strike a target the kraken can see within 120 feet of it. A target must make a **DC 23 Dexterity saving throw**, taking 22 (<Dice r="4d10" />) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

      - content: |
          The kraken can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The kraken regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

      - name: Lightning Storm (Costs 2 Actions)
        content: The kraken uses Lightning Storm.
      - name: Ink Cloud (Costs 3 Actions)
        content: |
          While underwater, the kraken expels an ink cloud in a 60-foot radius. The cloud spreads around corners, and that area is heavily obscured to creatures other than the kraken. Each creature other than the kraken that ends its turn there must succeed on a **DC 23 Constitution saving throw**, taking 16 (<Dice r="3d10" />) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A strong current disperses the cloud, which otherwise disappears at the end of the kraken's next turn.

          If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly
          petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to
          stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving
          throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or
          ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the

          creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be
          cursed with mummy rot. The cursed target can't regain hit points, and
          its hit point maximum decreases by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that
          elapse. If the curse reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the
          target dies, and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed
          by the remove curse spell or other magic.

          The mummy lord targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. If
          the target can see the mummy lord, it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom
          saving throw against this magic or become frightened until the end of
          the mummy's next turn. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or
          more, it is also paralyzed for the same duration. A target that succeeds
          on the saving throw is immune to the Dreadful Glare of all mummies and
          mummy lords for the next 24 hours.

          The cube takes up its entire space. Other creatures can enter the space,
          but a creature that does so is subjected to the cube's Engulf and has
          disadvantage on the saving throw.\nCreatures inside the cube can be seen
          but have total cover.\nA creature within 5 feet of the cube can take an
          action to pull a creature or object out of the cube. Doing so requires a
          successful DC 12 Strength check, and the creature making the attempt
          takes 10 (3d6) acid damage.\nThe cube can hold only one Large creature
          or up to four Medium or smaller creatures inside it at a time.
      - name: Transparent
        content: >-
          Even when the cube is in plain sight, it takes a successful DC 15 Wisdom
          (Perception) check to spot a cube that has neither moved nor attacked. A
          creature that tries to enter the cube's space while unaware of the cube
          is surprised by the cube.

        content: >-
          The cube moves up to its speed. While doing so, it can enter Large or
          smaller creatures' spaces. Whenever the cube enters a creature's space,
          the creature must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw.\nOn a successful
          save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of
          the cube. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the
          consequences of a failed saving throw.\nOn a failed save, the cube
          enters the creature's space, and the creature takes 10 (3d6) acid damage
          and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can't breathe, is restrained, and
          takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the cube's turns.
          When the cube moves, the engulfed creature moves with it.\nAn engulfed
          creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 12 Strength
          check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its
          choice within 5 feet of the cube.

          damage and is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the
          creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks
          and other effects outside the remorhaz, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid
          damage at the start of each of the remorhaz's turns.\nIf the remorhaz
          takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the
          remorhaz must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of
          that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a
          space within 10 feet oft he remorhaz. If the remorhaz dies, a swallowed
          creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse
          using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.

          The shield guardian is magically bound to an amulet. As long as the
          guardian and its amulet are on the same plane of existence, the amulet's
          wearer can telepathically call the guardian to travel to it, and the
          guardian knows the distance and direction to the amulet. If the guardian
          is within 60 feet of the amulet's wearer, half of any damage the wearer
          takes (rounded up) is transferred to the guardian.

        content: >-
          A spellcaster who wears the shield guardian's amulet can cause the
          guardian to store one spell of 4th level or lower. To do so, the wearer
          must cast the spell on the guardian. The spell has no effect but is
          stored within the guardian. When commanded to do so by the wearer or
          when a situation arises that was predefined by the spellcaster, the
          guardian casts the stored spell with any parameters set by the original
          caster, requiring no components. When the spell is cast or a new spell
          is stored, any previously stored spell is lost.

          throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a
          success.\n\nThird Roar. Each creature makes a DC 18 Constitution saving
          throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 44 (8d10) thunder damage and

      - name: Telepathic Bond
        content: >-
          The fiend ignores the range restriction on its telepathy when
          communicating with a creature it has charmed. The two don't even need to
          be on the same plane of existence.
      - name: Shapechanger
        content: >-
          The fiend can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium
          humanoid, or back into its true form. Without wings, the fiend loses its
          flying speed. Other than its size and speed, its statistics are the same
          in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed.
          It reverts to its true form if it dies.
    actions:
      - name: Thunderous Stomp (Recharge 6)
        content: >-
          The storm giant stomps the ground, triggering a thunderclap. All other
          creatures within 15 feet of the giant must succeed on a DC 17
          Constitution saving throw or take 33 (6d10) thunder damage and be
          deafened until the start of the giant's next turn. On a successful save,
          a creature takes half as much damage and isn't deafened. The thunderclap
          can be heard out to a range of 1,200 feet.
      - name: Claw (Fiend Form Only)
        content: >-
          Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 +
          3) slashing damage.
      - name: Charm
        content: >-
          One humanoid the fiend can see within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC
          15 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed for 1 day. The charmed
          target obeys the fiend's verbal or telepathic commands. If the target
          suffers any harm or receives a suicidal command, it can repeat the
          saving throw, ending the effect on a success. If the target successfully
          saves against the effect, or if the effect on it ends, the target is
          immune to this fiend's Charm for the next 24 hours.\nThe fiend can have
          only one target charmed at a time. If it charms another, the effect on
          the previous target ends.
      - name: Draining Kiss
        content: >-
          The fiend kisses a creature charmed by it or a willing creature. The
          target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against this magic,
          taking 32 (5d10 + 5) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much
          damage on a successful one. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by
          an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the
          target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its
          hit point maximum to 0.
      - name: Etherealness
        content: >-
          The fiend magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane,
          or vice versa.

          Any time the tarrasque is targeted by a magic missile spell, a line
          spell, or a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, roll a d6. On a 1

          and the effect is reflected back at the caster as though it originated
          from the tarrasque, turning the caster into the target.

          attacks: one with its bite, two with its claws, one with its horns, and
          one with its tai l. It can use its Swallow instead of its bite.
      - name: Bite
        content: >-
          Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 36 (4d12
          + 10) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled
          (escape DC 20). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and
          the tarrasque can't bite another target.
      - name: Claw

          on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

        content: >-
          Each creature of the tarrasque's choice within 120 feet of it and aware
          of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened
          for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each
          of its turns, with disadvantage if the tarrasque is within line of
          sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving
          throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to
          the tarrasque's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
      - name: Swallow
        content: >-
          The tarrasque makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller creature
          it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite's damage,
          the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the
          creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks
          and other effects outside the tarrasque, and it takes 56 (16d6) acid
          damage at the start of each of the tarrasque's turns.\nIf the tarrasque
          takes 60 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the
          tarrasque must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end
          of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in
          a space within 10 feet of the tarrasque. If the tarrasque dies, a
          swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the
          corpse by using 30 feet of movement, exiting prone.

          The treant magically animates one or two trees it can see within 60 feet

          have Intelligence and Charisma scores of 1, they can't speak, and they
          have only the Slam action option. An animated tree acts as an ally of
          the treant. The tree remains animate for 1 day or until it dies; until
          the treant dies or is more than 120 feet from the tree; or until the
          treant takes a bonus action to turn it back into an inanimate tree. The
          tree then takes root if possible.

          Whenever the troll takes at least 15 slashing damage at one time, roll a

          left.\n15- 18: One arm is severed from the troll if it has any arms
          left.\n19-20: The troll is decapitated, but the troll dies only if it
          can't regenerate. If it dies, so does the severed head.\nIf the troll
          finishes a short or long rest without reattaching a severed limb or
          head, the part regrows. At that point, the severed part dies. Until
          then, a severed part acts on the troll's initiative and has its own
          action and movement. A severed part has AC 13, 10 hit points, and the
          troll's Regeneration trait.\nA severed leg is unable to attack and has a
          speed of 5 feet.\nA severed arm has a speed of 5 feet and can make one
          claw attack on its turn, with disadvantage on the attack roll unless the
          troll can see the arm and its target. Each time the troll loses an arm,
          it loses a claw attack.\nIf its head is severed, the troll loses its
          bite attack and its body is blinded unless the head can see it. The
          severed head has a speed of 0 feet and the troll's Keen Smell trait. It
          can make a bite attack but only against a target in its space.\nThe
          troll's speed is halved if it's missing a leg. If it loses both legs, it
          falls prone. If it has both arms, it can crawl. With only one arm, it
          can still crawl, but its speed is halved. With no arms or legs, its
          speed is 0, and it can't benefit from bonuses to speed.

          walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its
          statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is
          wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts
          to its true form if it dies.\nWhile in mist form, the vampire can't take
          any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a
          flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's
          space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the
          mist can do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water. It
          has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws,
          and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes
          from sunlight.

          water. If it can't transform, it is destroyed.\nWhile it has 0 hit
          points in mist form, it can't revert to its vampire form, and it must
          reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its
          resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed
          until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its

          saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the vampire. The
          charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and
          protected. Although the target isn't under the vampire's control, it
          takes the vampire's requests or actions in the most favorable way it
          can, and it is a willing target for the vampire's bit attack.\nEach time
          the vampire or the vampire's companions do anything harmful to the
          target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a
          success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is
          destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or
          takes a bonus action to end the effect.
