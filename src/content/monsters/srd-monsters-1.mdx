        content: |
          While underwater, the aboleth is surrounded by transformative mucus. A creature that touches the aboleth or that hits it with a melee attack while within 5 ft. of it must make a **DC 14 Constitution saving throw**. On a failure, the creature is diseased for <Dice r="1d4" /> hours. The diseased creature can breathe only underwater.

        content: |
          Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a **DC 14 Constitution saving throw** or become diseased. The disease has no effect for 1 minute and can be removed by any magic that cures disease. After 1 minute, the diseased creature's skin becomes translucent and slimy, the creature can't regain hit points unless it is underwater, and the disease can be removed only by heal or another disease-curing spell of 6th level or higher. **When the creature is outside a body of water, it takes 6 (<Dice r="1d12" />) acid damage every 10 minutes unless moisture is applied to the skin before 10 minutes have passed.**

        content: |
          The aboleth targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a **DC 14 Wisdom saving throw** or be magically charmed by the aboleth until the aboleth dies or until it is on a different plane of existence from the target. The charmed target is under the aboleth's control and can't take reactions, and the aboleth and the target can communicate telepathically with each other over any distance.

          Whenever the charmed target takes damage, the target can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. No more than once every 24 hours, the target can also repeat the saving throw when it is at least 1 mile away from the aboleth.

          The deva magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a
          challenge rating equal to or less than its own, or back into its true
          form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is
          wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the deva's
          choice).
          In a new form, the deva retains its game statistics and
          ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and
          special senses are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any
          statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary actions,
          and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks.

          attaches to it. If the cloaker has advantage against the target, the
          cloaker attaches to the target's head, and the target is blinded and
          unable to breathe while the cloaker is attached. While attached, the
          cloaker can make this attack only against the target and has advantage
          on the attack roll. The cloaker can detach itself by spending 5 feet of
          its movement. A creature, including the target, can take its action to
          detach the cloaker by succeeding on a DC 16 Strength check.

          Each creature within 60 feet of the cloaker that can hear its moan and
          that isn't an aberration must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or
          become frightened until the end of the cloaker's next turn. If a
          creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the
          cloaker's moan for the next 24 hours.
      - name: Phantasms (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)
        content: >-
          The cloaker magically creates three illusory duplicates of itself if it
          isn't in bright light. The duplicates move with it and mimic its
          actions, shifting position so as to make it impossible to track which
          cloaker is the real one. If the cloaker is ever in an area of bright
          light, the duplicates disappear.\nWhenever any creature targets the
          cloaker with an attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains,
          that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker
          or one of the duplicates. A creature is unaffected by this magical
          effect if it can't see or if it relies on senses other than sight.\nA
          duplicate has the cloaker's AC and uses its saving throws. If an attack
          hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw against an
          effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears.

          wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the couatl's
          choice).\nIn a new form, the couatl retains its game statistics and
          ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and
          other actions are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any
          statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary actions,
          and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks. If the new
          form has a bite attack, the couatl can use its bite in that form.

          frightened until the end of its turn.

        content: >-
          The devil magically forms an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it
          can see within 60 feet of it. The wall is 1 foot thick and up to 30 feet
          long and 10 feet high, or it's a hemispherical dome up to 20 feet in
          diameter.\nWhen the wall appears, each creature in its space is pushed
          out of it by the shortest route. The creature chooses which side of the
          wall to end up on, unless the creature is incapacitated. The creature
          then makes a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) cold damage
          on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nThe wall
          lasts for 1 minute or until the devil is incapacitated or dies. The wall
          can be damaged and breached; each 10-foot section has AC 5, 30 hit
          points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold,
          necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. If a section is destroyed, it
          leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied.
          Whenever a creature finishes moving through the frigid air on a turn,
          willingly or otherwise, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution
          saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as
          much damage on a successful one. The frigid air dissipates when the rest
          of the wall vanishes.

          ground the dragon can see within 120 feet of it, creating a
          20-foot-high, 5-foot-radius geyser. Each creature in the geyser's area

          other than the dragon on the ground in that area must succeed on a DC 15
          Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.\n\t• Volcanic gases form a
          cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see
          within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area
          is lightly obscured. It lasts until initiative count 20 on the next

          regards the dryad as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected.

          the dryad or its allies do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat

          the effect lasts 24 hours or until the dryad dies, is on a different
          plane of existence from the target, or ends the effect as a bonus
          action. If a target's saving throw is successful, the target is immune
          to the dryad's Fey Charm for the next 24 hours.\nThe dryad can have no

      The tyrannical duergar, also known as gray dwarves, dwell in fantastic
      cities deep in the Underdark. Using ancient dwarven knowledge and myriad
      slaves, they work tirelessly to expand their subterranean
      kingdoms.\\n\\nMost duergar (including females) are bald and have ashen gray
      skin. They wear drab clothing designed to blend in with stone, along with
      simple jewelry that reflects their severe and utilitarian
      demeanor.\\n\\nSlaves to Slavers. The duergar were once dwarves, before
      their greed and endless delving beneath the earth brought them into contact
      with the mind flayers. Held in captivity for generations by the illithids,
      the dwarves eventually won their independence with the aid of the evil god
      Laduguer. Slavery had forever changed them, however, darkening their spirits
      to make the duergar as evil as the tyrants they had escaped. Despite winning
      their freedom, duergar are dour, pessimistic, untrusting creatures, always
      toiling and complaining, with no memory of what it means to be happy or
      proud. Their craftsmanship and accomplishments endure, yet they are bereft
      of warmth or artistry.\\n\\nDuergar make war against their dwarven kin and
      all other subterranean races. They forge alliances when it is convenient,
      then break those alliances when they have nothing more to gain. They take
      and hold slaves to toil in the Underdark, regarding them as free labor and
      crude currency.\\n\\nTough as Stone. Like dwarves, duergar have strong
      constitutions. Adding to their physical stamina is an incredible mental
      fortitude resulting from their time as slaves of the illithids. A duergar’s
      mind is a fortress, able to shrug off charms, illusions, and other
      spells.\\n\\nBorn of Darkness. The Underdark is saturated with strange
      magical power, which the duergar absorbed over generations of imprisonment.
      A duergar can increase its size and strength for a short time, becoming a
      powerful ogre-sized warrior. If it faces a foe it can’t fight, or when
      spying on creatures approaching its territory, it can just as easily become
      invisible to slip away into the darkness.\\n\\nEons spent in the Underdark
      also sharpened their darkvision, allowing them to see twice as far as other
      dwarves. This keen eyesight comes at a cost, however, as a duergar’s vision
      is compromised by sunlight.\\n\\nInfernal Master. Asmodeus, Lord of the Nine
      Hells, has been known to impersonate duergar gods in order to cultivate the
      evil brimming in the hearts of the gray dwarves. He offers them divine
      guidance and vengeance against their enemies while urging them on toward
      greater acts of tyranny, all the while concealing his true identity.

    description: >
      Tens of thousands of years ago, the elves were divided, with those of
      benevolent disposition battling those that were selfish and cruel. The war
      among elvenkind ended when the good elves banished their malevolent kin to
      the subterranean depths. Here, in the lightless caverns and endless warrens
      of twisting passages, the dark elves — the drow — found refuge. They also
      found leadership in the only elven deity who had not forsaken them. At her
      command, the dark elves built an empire in the underworld.\\n\\nChildren of
      Lolth. The drow worship Lolth, a deity who resides in the Abyss. Known as
      the Spider Queen or the Demon Queen of Spiders, she is the figure around
      which the dark elves have built their subterranean civilization. Whatever
      she demands, the drow do.\\n\\nThe wickedest of elves, drow are seldom seen
      by the surface world. Though they plot to destroy the elves that banished
      them, they no longer see themselves as exiles. They are the destined rulers
      of the darkness, and when Lolth commands them to rise up and destroy their
      surface-dwelling kin, they will.\\n\\nCreatures of Darkness. The drow have
      lived underground for so long that they have evolved to their surroundings
      and can see in the dark. However, they can no longer stand sunlight. When
      slaves are in short supply in the Underdark, the drow send raiding parties
      to the surface to capture humanoids under cover of darkness, bringing them
      back to their cities to be tortured into submission. Beyond those occasional
      excursions, the drow are content to remain in their subterranean realm,
      where they feel secure and in control.\\n\\nUnderdark Cities. The dark elves
      build fantastic cities in enormous caverns where food and water are
      abundant. Their ability to sculpt stone rivals that of the greatest dwarf
      artisans, yet their structures retain a decidedly elven aesthetic. Though
      appearing delicate, drow settlements are structurally sound and remarkably
      resilient. The drow like to hollow out enormous stalagmites and stalactites,
      creating populated spires that rise from the floors and ceilings.\\n\\nA
      drow city is a sprawling metropolis enclosed by high walls. Non-drow
      visitors must conduct their business outside the walls under watchful eyes.
      The drow raise and keep giant spiders to help protect their cities against
      intruders, even as they drape those cities in beautiful webbing, creating a
      gossamer snare to catch flying enemies that would otherwise soar over the
      walls.\\n\\nPoison Predilection. Distilled from spider venom and the flora
      of the Underdark, poison can be found in abundance among the drow, and it
      plays an important part in their culture and politics. Drow mages concoct a
      viscid toxin that leaves enemies unconscious. Drow warriors coat their
      blades and crossbow bolts with this venom, looking forward to the
      interrogation and torture that follows combat.\\n\\nDrow Magic. Just as the
      drow have adapted to underground life, so too has their magic. In addition
      to using that magic to carve their cities from stone, they empower their
      weapons, create dangerous new magic items, and summon demons from the Abyss.
      Drow spellcasters are supremely arrogant and never hesitate to use their
      magic in the most abhorrent ways.\\n\\nArms and Armor. Drow craft weapons
      made of adamantine, a dark and supernaturally hard metal. Drow artisans
      adorn their weapons and armor with web-like filigree and spider motifs, and
      mages sometimes imbue items with magic to enhance their effectiveness.
      However, such magic fades when exposed to sunlight, so that magical drow
      weapons and armor rarely retain their enhancement bonuses and magical
      properties when brought to the surface.\\n\\nCutthroat Politics. Drow
      politics are cutthroat and rife with intrigue. When drow work together, it
      is typically to destroy a common foe and ensure their own survival, and such
      alliances are short lived and fraught with peril.\\n\\nDrow society is
      divided into noble houses, each ruled by a matron who seeks to raise the
      prestige and power of her house above all others. Other high-ranking members
      of the house are blood relatives, while the middling ranks are flush with
      drow from weaker families that have sworn fealty to the greater house.
      Clinging precariously to the bottom rung of a house’s social ladder are the
      house slaves, made up of drow of low birth and the occasional non-drow
      captive.\\n\\nMatriarchal Rule. Lolth, through her faithful priestesses,
      dictates the rules of drow society, ensuring that her orders and plots are
      carried out. Since Lolth is prone to manifesting on the Material Plane and
      directly punishing those that disobey her, the drow have learned to heed
      what she says and do as her priestesses command.\\n\\nIn drow society, males
      are subservient to females. A male drow might lead an Underdark patrol or a
      raiding party to the surface, but he reports to a female drow — either the
      matron of his house or one of her hand-picked female subordinates. Although
      male drow can fill almost any function in drow society, they can’t be
      priests, nor can they rule a house.

          Genies have a variety of magical capabilities, including spells. A few
          have even greater powers that allow them to alter their appearance or
          the nature of reality.\n\nDisguises.\nSome genies can veil themselves in
          illusion to pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can
          innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer
          duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the
          true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer
          duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a
          rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as
          well.\nWishes.\nThe genie power to grant wishes is legendary among
          mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility,
          can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three
          wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its
          limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time
          (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend
          its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's
          existence.\nTo be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie
          states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on
          the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the
          genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by
          exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is
          usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit.

          as long as the djinni maintains concentration (as if concentrating on a
          spell). Any creature but the djinni that enters the whirlwind must
          succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be restrained by it. The
          djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60 feet as an action, and creatures
          restrained by the whirlwind move with it. The whirlwind ends if the
          djinni loses sight of it.\nA creature can use its action to free a
          creature restrained by the whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on
          a DC 18 Strength check. If the check succeeds, the creature is no longer
          restrained and moves to the nearest space outside the whirlwind.

          body. The ghost now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of
          awareness. The ghost can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other
          effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment,
          Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and
          frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but
          doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or
          proficiencies.\n     The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit
          points, the ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned or
          forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the
          possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 ft.
          of the body. The target is immune to this ghost's Possession for 24
          hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.

          * 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying

          For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level
          spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The
          spell save DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell
          attack bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.
      - name: Hag Eye (Coven Only)
        content: >-
          A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from
          a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other
          wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for
          safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see
          what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence.
          A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60
          feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage
          and is blinded for 24 hours.\nA hag coven can have only one hag eye at a
          time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to
          perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it
          while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than
          performing the ritual, they must start over.

          Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 +
          4) slashing damage.
      - name: Illusory Appearance
        content: >-
          The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a
          magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her
          general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a
          bonus action to end it or if she dies.\nThe changes wrought by this
          effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag
          could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel
          her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually
          inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation)
          check to discern that the hag is disguised.
      - name: Invisible Passage
        content: >-
          The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or
          until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While
          invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be
          tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible
          with her.

          A night hag carries two very rare magic items that she must craft for
          herself If either object is lost, the night hag will go to great lengths
          to retrieve it, as creating a new tool takes time and
          effort.\nHeartstone: This lustrous black gem allows a night hag to
          become ethereal while it is in her possession. The touch of a heartstone
          also cures any disease. Crafting a heartstone takes 30 days.\nSoul Bag:
          When an evil humanoid dies as a result of a night hag's Nightmare
          Haunting, the hag catches the soul in this black sack made of stitched
          flesh. A soul bag can hold only one evil soul at a time, and only the
          night hag who crafted the bag can catch a soul with it. Crafting a soul
          bag takes 7 days and a humanoid sacrifice (whose flesh is used to make
          the bag).

          arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than

          The hag magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium female humanoid, or
          back into her true form. Her statistics are the same in each form. Any

          The hag magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or

        content: >-
          While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag magically touches a sleeping
          humanoid on the Material Plane. A protection from evil and good spell
          cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a magic circle. As
          long as the contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these
          visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its
          rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect
          reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the
          target was evil, its soul is trapped in the hag's soul bag. The
          reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until removed by the
          greater restoration spell or similar magic.

          25 or more damage in a single turn, one of its heads dies. If all its
          heads die, the hydra dies.\nAt the end of its turn, it grows two heads
          for each of its heads that died since its last turn, unless it has taken
          fire damage since its last turn. The hydra regains 10 hit points for
